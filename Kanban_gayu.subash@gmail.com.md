1) What are the differences between Scrum and Kanban?

Difficulty: Mid

Answer:

Scrum	
In case of a problem, Scrum Master is the problem solver.
Kanban
Every member is allowed to pick up a problem and solve it.
Scrum
Large projects can be broken down into smaller parts through sprints. It is more suited for new development releases.	
Kanban
Suitable for smaller projects that require continuous production. It is more suited for maintenance releases.
Scrum
Production is measured through the velocity of the sprint. “Velocity is the rate at which team progresses sprint by sprint”. The important feature of 
velocity that it can’t be compared to two different scrum teams since there can be 2 or 3 scrum teams working for a release.	
Kanban
Production is measured through the cycle or time taken to finish the project.
Scrum
Sprint durations are fixed. It varies from 2 weeks to 4 weeks.
Kanban
Kanban is not based on the duration.

2) What are the differences between Agile and Lean?

Difficulty: Mid

Answer:

Agile emphasizes making software development more flexible by delivering smaller chunks of work more frequently, whereas lean emphasizes making the entire
process sustainable through continuous improvement.The build-measure-learn model is used in Lean. Kanban is the preferred method of working for Lean.

3) Could you tell me what scrumban is? What are its advantages?

Difficulty: Mid

Answer:

Scrumban is a combination of the scrum and kanban methodologies. It incorporates boards and continuous work from kanban, together with regular meetings 
and task limitations from scrum. It has certain advantages depending on the nature of the project. For example, it is better than scrum for ongoing 
maintenance work, as it removes the sprint-based system. It is also better than kanban if you have consistent bottlenecks, as it limits the number of 
simultaneous items on a board. Scrumban removes the time limits of scrum and makes work continuous, but retains scrum's short regular stand-up meetings.
